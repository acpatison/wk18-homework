## Description
üîç This project is was created as a Fitness Tracker. The goal was to be able to log different types of exercises in a workout on a given day. Additionally, the user could track the name of the workout, type of workout, weight used, sets executed, reps per set completed, and the total time duration. The user could also track cardio exercises by duration of exercise and distance traveled. This project was a great way to gain a better understanding of how to utilize MongoDB instead of using SQL to store information for later use.
